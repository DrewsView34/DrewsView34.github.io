BeerSearch searches for beers dependent on the input from the user from the Command Line Interface(CLI). It utlizes the PunkAPI which has different microbeers. To use the BeerSearch; the user must build a custom gem file, or fork and clone the BeerSearch repository(https://github.com/drewsview34/beer_search). Once the user is setup, they are welcomed and asked if they are 21 years of age. If no is selected, the program breaks and lets the user know they are not old enough. If yes is selected, they the program executes the next line of code which is the beer selection method. CLI next displays the selection of beers. When a beer is selected; the CLI will get the selected beers information that includes the description, tagline, and abv are displayed. Once the user has reviewed the information, the program will ask the user if they would like to perform another search or exit. If they choose to perform another search, the program will loop back by displaying the original list of beers. If user chooses to exit, the program says goodbye and exits.


I'm proud of what I've created and I plan on improving, perhaps, even changing the BeerSearch to have a enhance user freindly CLI experience. Building this program was exciting and frustrating.
