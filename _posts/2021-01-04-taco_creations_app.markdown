The Taco Creations App utilizes Active Record and Sinatra to build an MVC app that utilizes standard CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. MVC stands for Models, Views, and Controllers. Models. Models has the associations with inherit from ActiveRecord. The Views acts as the user interface and displays the HTML to the user as an erb file. The Controllers transport the information between the views the and models. This app also utlizes a database that the models interacts with. It takes the information from the database and gives it to the Controllers. And the Controllers give the Models informatoin on how to save information in the database to the Models.
